## General

### What is the Respondeo?

The Respondeo is a modern, full-stack quiz platform built with Next.js 16. It features OIDC authentication, role-based access control, AI-powered quiz generation, real-time leaderboards, and a comprehensive REST API.

### Is it free to use?

Yes, Respondeo is open-source and MIT licensed. You can use it for free, modify it, and deploy it anywhere.

### What are the system requirements?

- **Runtime:** Bun >= 1.3.8
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (any version)
- **OIDC Provider:** Any standards-compliant provider
- **Optional:** Redis/Valkey for caching

## Authentication & Permissions

### Which OIDC providers are supported?

Any standards-compliant OIDC provider works:

- Keycloak
- Auth0
- Okta
- Authentik
- Pocket ID
- Google Workspace
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- And more...

See [Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication) for setup instructions.

### Can I use it without OIDC?

No, OIDC authentication is required. The app doesn't support local username/password accounts.

### How do I make quizzes public?

Enable public access via environment variables:

```bash
RBAC_PUBLIC_BROWSE_QUIZZES=true
RBAC_PUBLIC_VIEW_QUIZ=true
RBAC_PUBLIC_PLAY_QUIZ=true
RBAC_PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD=true
```

See [RBAC Guide](/guides/rbac) for details.

### Can guests play quizzes anonymously?

Yes, if `RBAC_PUBLIC_PLAY_QUIZ=true`. Guest attempts are rate-limited and not saved to the database (no user ID to associate).

### How do roles work?

Roles are mapped from OIDC groups via environment variables:

```bash
RBAC_ROLE_ADMIN_GROUPS=admin,staff
RBAC_ROLE_CREATOR_GROUPS=teachers
RBAC_DEFAULT_ROLE=user
```

Users are assigned the highest priority role that matches their OIDC groups. See [RBAC Guide](/guides/rbac).

### Can I change permissions per role?

Yes, via `RBAC_ROLE_*_PERMISSIONS` environment variables:

```bash
RBAC_ROLE_USER_PERMISSIONS=quiz:browse,quiz:view,quiz:play,leaderboard:view,leaderboard:submit,ai:quiz-generate
```

## Features

### How does AI quiz generation work?

The app uses the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) with support for:

- OpenAI (default)
- Anthropic
- Google AI

Set your provider and API key:

```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

See [AI Generation Guide](/features/ai-generation).

### Is web search required for AI?

No, web search is optional. Enable it for up-to-date quizzes on recent topics:

```bash
AI_WEB_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
```

### How does image search work?

The app integrates with Unsplash API for image selection:

```bash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-key-here
```

See [Image Search Guide](/features/image-search).

### Is caching required?

No, Redis/Valkey caching is optional. The app works without it, but caching significantly improves performance under load.

See [Caching Guide](/features/caching).

### Can I use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL?

No, the app is built specifically for PostgreSQL using Bun's native `bun:sql` driver and Drizzle ORM's PostgreSQL dialect.

### Can I use SQLite?

No, PostgreSQL is required. The app uses PostgreSQL-specific features and Bun's native PostgreSQL driver.

## Deployment

### Where can I deploy it?

The app deploys anywhere that supports:

- Bun runtime (or Node.js with Bun compatibility)
- PostgreSQL database
- (Optional) Redis/Valkey

Popular options:

- **Vercel** — Easiest, use Vercel Postgres
- **Docker** — Included `compose.yaml`
- **VPS** — Any Linux server with Bun installed
- **Railway** — Supports Bun and PostgreSQL
- **Fly.io** — Docker deployments

See [Deployment Guide](/guides/deployment).

### Does it work on Vercel?

Yes! The app is optimized for Vercel. Use:

- **Vercel Postgres** — Managed database
- **Or Neon/Supabase** — External PostgreSQL

See [Deployment Guide](/guides/deployment#vercel-deployment).

### Can I run it in Docker?

Yes, a `compose.yaml` is included:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL, Valkey, and the app (if you add a Dockerfile for the app).

### How do I handle migrations in production?

Migrations run automatically during `bun run build`. If you need to run them separately:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

For zero-downtime deployments, run migrations before deploying the new version.

## API

### How do I get an API key?

API keys must be created by an administrator through the web UI at `/settings`.

See [API Keys Guide](/features/api-keys).

### What can I do with the API?

The API provides full CRUD access to:

- Quizzes (list, get, create, update, delete)
- Quiz attempts (submit, view results)
- Leaderboards (per-quiz and global)

See [API Reference](/api-reference/overview).

### Is there a rate limit?

Yes, API keys are rate-limited to **100 requests per minute** by default.

### Can I change the rate limit?

Not currently via configuration. You'd need to modify the code in `apps/web/lib/rate-limit.ts`.

### Is there an SDK?

Not yet, but you can generate one from the OpenAPI spec at `/docs/openapi.json` using tools like:

- [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
- [swagger-codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)

## Performance

### How many users can it handle?

The app has been load tested to **5000 concurrent users** with 0% error rate when using Redis/Valkey caching.

See [Testing Guide](/development/testing) for details.

### How can I improve performance?

1. **Enable caching** — Add Redis/Valkey
2. **Tune PostgreSQL** — Increase connections and memory
3. **Use connection pooling** — PgBouncer for serverless
4. **Enable CDN** — For static assets (Vercel does this automatically)

See [Caching Guide](/features/caching).

### What's the difference between Redis and Valkey?

Valkey is an open-source Redis fork. They're compatible — the app supports both via the same `REDIS_URL` variable.

## Development

### How do I contribute?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and linting
5. Submit a pull request

### How do I run tests?

```bash
bun test
```

For load testing:

```bash
bun run loadtest
```

See [Testing Guide](/development/testing).

### Can I use npm/pnpm/yarn instead of Bun?

Not recommended. The app uses Bun-specific features:

- `bun:sql` — Native PostgreSQL driver
- Bun's native Redis client
- Bun workspaces

### Is there a development roadmap?
