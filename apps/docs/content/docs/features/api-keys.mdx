description: Programmatic access with API keys
---

Respondeo provides API keys for programmatic access to the REST API. API keys are managed through the web interface and inherit permissions dynamically from the user's role.

## Creating API Keys

Only administrators can create and manage API keys.

1. Sign in as an admin user
2. Navigate to **Settings** (`/settings`)
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Optionally set an expiration date
5. Copy the API key (it won't be shown again)

## Using API Keys

Include the API key in the `x-api-key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here" \
  https://respondeo.example.com/api/quizzes
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://respondeo.example.com/api/quizzes", {
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "your_api_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

const quizzes = await response.json();
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'x-api-key': 'your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://respondeo.example.com/api/quizzes', headers=headers)
quizzes = response.json()
```

## Permissions

API keys inherit permissions from the user's current role dynamically. This means:

- **No stored permissions**: API keys don't have a fixed set of permissions
- **Real-time updates**: If a user's role permissions change, all their API keys reflect those changes immediately
- **No regeneration needed**: No need to recreate API keys when permissions change

### Available Scopes

| Scope            | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quizzes:read`   | List and view quizzes, view leaderboards                 |
| `quizzes:write`  | Create, update, and delete quizzes (requires admin role) |
| `attempts:read`  | View quiz attempts                                       |
| `attempts:write` | Submit quiz attempts                                     |

The effective permissions of an API key are determined by the user's role at request time. See [RBAC Guide](/guides/rbac) for role configuration.

## Rate Limiting

API keys are rate-limited to **100 requests per minute** by default.

When rate-limited, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
}
```

With HTTP status `429 Too Many Requests`.

### Rate Limit Headers

The API includes rate limit information in response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit` — Total requests allowed per window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` — Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` — Unix timestamp when the limit resets

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep keys secret** — Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Use environment variables** — Store keys in `.env` files (git-ignored)
3. **Rotate regularly** — Delete old keys and create new ones periodically
4. **Set expiration** — Use expiration dates when creating keys
5. **Limit scope** — Ensure users only have necessary permissions
6. **Monitor usage** — Review API key usage regularly in admin panel

## Deleting API Keys

To delete an API key:

1. Navigate to **Settings** (`/settings`)
2. Find the key in the list
3. Click **"Delete"**
4. Confirm the action

Deleted keys are immediately revoked and cannot be recovered.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

- Verify the key is correct (no extra spaces or characters)
- Check that the key hasn't been deleted
- Ensure you're using the `x-api-key` header (not `Authorization`)

### "Insufficient permissions"

- Check the user's role associated with the API key
- Verify the role has the required permissions
- See [RBAC Guide](/guides/rbac) for permission configuration

### "Rate limit exceeded"

- Wait for the rate limit window to reset
- Check the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header for reset time
- Consider implementing request batching or caching
